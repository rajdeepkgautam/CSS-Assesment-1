    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li> <span style="text-decoration:line-through"> CSS is not neccessary </span> <span style="background-color: yellow;">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li> External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
        <ul type= "circle">
            <li>Inline - by using the styke attribute inside the HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Internal  - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span style="background-color: yellow;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate and erasier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>

When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique eleement. ID is also
special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.<br>

In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the
element. <br>

There is awide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
